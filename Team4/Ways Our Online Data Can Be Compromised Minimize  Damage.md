### 10 Must-Know Tips For Keeping Your Personal Data Safe

Here are some essential tips from the National Cybersecurity Alliance to help protect your personal data online:

1. **Use Strong, Unique Passwords**  
   Make sure each account has a strong, unique password to reduce the risk of a breach affecting multiple accounts.
   
2. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
   Adding another layer of security beyond just passwords can make it harder for hackers to access your accounts.
   
3. **Keep Software Updated**  
   Regularly update your software to patch vulnerabilities that cybercriminals may exploit.
   
4. **Be Aware of Phishing Scams**  
   Avoid clicking on suspicious links or providing personal information to unverified sources.
   
5. **Secure Your Home Network**  
   Change the default passwords on your home router and use encryption to protect your Wi-Fi network.
   
6. **Monitor Your Bank Statements**  
   Regularly check your bank accounts and credit reports for any unauthorized transactions.
   
7. **Limit Sharing of Personal Information**  
   Be mindful of the personal information you share online, especially on social media.
   
8. **Backup Your Data**  
   Regularly backup your data to prevent loss in case of a malware attack.
   
9. **Use a VPN on Public Wi-Fi**  
   Protect your data by using a virtual private network (VPN) when accessing public Wi-Fi.
   
10. **Review Privacy Settings**  
    Regularly review and adjust the privacy settings on your accounts to control who has access to your data.

### What To Do When Your Data Is Breached

If your data is compromised in a breach, the National Cybersecurity Alliance recommends the following steps:

1. **Change Your Passwords**  
   Immediately change the passwords for the affected accounts and any other accounts using the same or similar passwords.
   
2. **Enable MFA**  
   If multi-factor authentication isn’t already set up, activate it for your accounts to enhance security.
   
3. **Monitor Accounts Closely**  
   Watch for any unusual activity on your financial accounts and email inbox.
   
4. **Report Fraud**  
   If you notice unauthorized transactions, report the fraud to your bank or credit card company immediately.
   
5. **Place a Fraud Alert**  
   Consider placing a fraud alert or credit freeze with major credit bureaus to prevent further unauthorized activity.
   
6. **Use Identity Theft Monitoring Services**  
   You may want to sign up for identity theft protection services, particularly if your Social Security number or sensitive information has been exposed.

### How Data Breach Fatigue Can Impact Your Digital Health

According to the National Cybersecurity Alliance, data breach fatigue is real, and it can negatively affect how we manage our online security. When we become desensitized to the constant news of breaches, we may let our guard down, stop taking preventative measures, or delay responding when our own data is compromised. Here’s how to combat this:

- **Stay Informed**  
  Keep yourself updated on the latest cybersecurity trends and threats to avoid falling victim to breach fatigue.
  
- **Proactive Data Management**  
  Continue to apply good security practices, even if the breaches seem overwhelming. Stay disciplined about changing passwords and monitoring accounts.
  
- **Adopt New Security Tools**  
  Take advantage of evolving security technologies, like MFA or VPNs, to strengthen your defenses.
