# **Machine Learning** 

In the 1950s Alan Turing created a test to prove if computers were intelligent and Arthur Samuels created the first computer learning program, on paper, that could play a game of Chess. Machine learning is defined as artificial intelligence that permits computes to learn from data and make decisions on its own without being programmed. Machine learning will use data, statistics, trial and error in order to train a computer the way that a task should be performed. Machine learning algorithms function in a similar way as babies learn by being shown an example as opposed to being told what the example is in words. 
A machine learning model is a program that detects patterns or makes decisions from previously unseen data. It can be applied to tasks like recommendations and voice or face recognition. From the 1950s its development gradually shifts from "knowledge-driven" to "data-driven" in the 1990s.


# Uses # 
Machine learning is being utilized in these ways:
* chat bots on websites (to predict and provide answers to frequently asked questions)
* fraud detection for online sales transactions, 
* data-mining for retail, healthcare, 
* e-mail filters (that send incoming unsolicited messages to your spam box), 
* Google search is curated by the data you input providing you with what you have requested in the past. 

For every positive, there could be a potential negative impact if not examined ethically.

## Bias and Fairness
There are a number of ethical questions in regard to the use of machine learning. Deep considerations, as well as inclusive collaboration will ensure that biases, fairness, privacy, and security concerns will be addressed. In order to ensure the most equitable use of these programs and that it will be helpful for all people.
